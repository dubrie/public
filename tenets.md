### Philosophies
Something I have whole-heartedly bought into and is a driving influence in all of my decision making.

- Measure, Compare, Adjust  
Create feedback loops everywhere I can including my own Philosophies, Beliefs, Lifehacks, etc. Write things down as a commitment to them, measure progress, compare changes, adjust to maximize benefits and minimize negatives.  
Inspiration: [James Clear](http://jamesclear.com/feedback-loops)

- Sweat Once A Day  
Go for a run, take the stairs to/from your office or home, dance, do push-ups or sit-ups during television commercials, whatever it is you enjoy that makes you sweat - do it everyday.

-  Read At Least 30 Minutes A Day  
It's rumored that Winston Churchill read a book every night because it helped him think better.

- Be A Thermostat, Not A Thermometer  
Don't just report on the things around you, effect that change you want to see in them instead.  
Inspiration: [Cory Booker](https://www.facebook.com/corybooker/posts/10150525338532228)

- Have A Drink With Dinner  
Drinking in moderation has shown to produce certain health benefits. Having a drink at night has helped my body shutdown for the evening resulting in more restful sleep and better overall health.

- Show Up, Work Hard, Listen, Do What You Say You Are Going To Do  
I've always subconsiously lived by these 4 rules but never had it put as succinctly as this until I heard Jim Harbaugh say it and saw it written on a wall in the University of Michigan football locker room. The best part for me is that none of these skills require talent or things outside of your control, just commitment and work ethic.

### Lifehacks
Little changes to a regimented routine in an attempt to get more out of what I'm already doing.

- Filters emails that contain the word "unsubscribe" to another folder  
Helps to reduce the noise of my inbox and allows me to address them as necessary.
Inspiration: [Inbox Zero](http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/zero-dark-inbox)

- Include Emojis  
I've found that including emoji characters in my messages slows down the speed at which I reply and forces me to think more about what I'm really trying to say. Also, they are entertaining.

- No Laptops At Meetings  
Most meetings are poorly run and have poor time management. Refusing to bring a laptop unless absolutely necessary has forced me to focus on what every person is saying and quickly call out things that are not relevant to goal of the meeting.
Inspiration: [You Should Ban Laptops At Board Meetings](http://techcrunch.com/2011/10/31/why-you-should-ban-laptops-at-board-meetings/)

- Don't Talk For 10 Minutes  
Unless I am leading a meeting or directly addressed, I refrain from talking for 10 minutes to absorb others perspectives and understanding of the issues at hand before weighing in myself.
Inspiration: [Amazon Meeting Policies](http://fortune.com/2012/11/16/amazons-jeff-bezos-the-ultimate-disrupter/)

- No Pop At Work  
I enjoy the occassional pop but when it is free and readily available through work it becomes too easy to pass up. For my caffeine needs I have substituted chai tea lattes and lemon herbal tea during work hours.

### Recent Changes
Trying something new to see what the results are.

- Don't Reuse Adjectives During The Day  
I've been challenging myself to not use an adjective twice in a day. Calling things "awesome" 15 times a day starts to degrade the value of the adjective overall. Additionally, it is forcing me to be more creative and deliberate in how I describe things. Plus, having a larger vocabulary has other benefits as well: [Vocabulary Size](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/14/magazine/14FOB-onlanguage-t.html?_r=0)

- Wake Up 1 Hour Earlier  
I recently got back from a trip to Italy and the jet lag has been waking me up in the 4-5am hours instead of my normal 6-7am hours. With daylight creeping earlier and earlier as well I want to try to keep this trend going and see if there is a change in my productivity, activity, energy, and bedtime. I've struggled with falling asleep at night so the hope is that waking up early will help my productivity for the day as well as getting me to sleep at night.

### Recent Results
The results from the things I've changed recently.  Successful trials can move to lifehacks and successful likehacks can move to philosophies. Unsuccessful trials will fall away and be retained here.

- Stand Whenever Possible  
  - Results: Successful
  - Details: I've been using a stand-up desk for about 5 years now but because of a weird bug that messes up [window sizes when disconnecting a MacBook Pro from an external monitor](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/chrome/nDXWuqYj2zA), I've been sitting more at my desk with my laptop. I'm also training for my 4th marathon (and hopefully 5th!) where posture and form is very important especially in the later miles. Standing at my desk for 6 hours a day should help me get the core strength and posture back to levels that will help in training/race.

- No Pop At Work  
  - Results: Successful
  - Details: I've become a much bigger customer at the local Starbucks and Tea/Coffee Shops since changing this which has required a few adjustments to my budget but my sleep patterns have vastly improved and I haven't been sick outside of a runny nose here and there. My energy levels at work have gone up with the drop in sugary drink intake and I feel less drained at the end of the day. The dentist even noticed a difference in my tooth enamel and pockets which I will partially attribute to this.
