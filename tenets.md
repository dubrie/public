### Philosophies
Something I have whole-heartedly bought into and is a driving influence in all of my decision making.

- Measure, Compare, Adjust
Create feedback loops everywhere I can including my own Philosophies, Beliefs, Lifehacks, etc. Write things down as a commitment to them, measure progress, compare changes, adjust to maximize benefits and minimize negatives.

- Sweat Once A Day
Go for a run, take the stairs to/from your office or home, dance, do push-ups or sit-ups during television commercials, whatever it is you enjoy that makes you sweat - do it everyday.

-  Read At Least 30 Minutes A Day
It's rumored that Winston Churchill read a book every night because it helped him think better.

- Be A Thermostat, Not A Thermometer
Don't just report on the things around you, effect that change you want to see in them instead.

- Have A Drink With Dinner
Drinking in moderation has shown to produce certain health benefits. Having a drink at night has helped my body shutdown for the evening resulting in more restful sleep and better overall health.

### Lifehacks
Little changes to a regimented routine in an attempt to get more out of what I'm already doing.

- Filters emails by "unsubscribe" to another folder
Helps to reduce the noise of my inbox and allows me to address them as necessary.

- Include Emojis
I've found that including emoji characters in my messages slows down the speed at which I reply and forces me to think more about what I'm really trying to say. Also, they are entertaining.

- No Laptops At Meetings 
Most meetings are poorly run and have poor time management. Refusing to bring a laptop unless absolutely necessary has forced me to focus on what every person is saying and quickly call out things that are not relevant to goal of the meeting.

- Don't Talk For 10 Minutes
Unless I am leading a meeting or directly addressed, I refrain from talking for 10 minutes to absorb others perspectives and understanding of the issues at hand before weighing in myself.

### Recent Changes
Trying something new to see what the results are.

- No Pop At Work
I enjoy the occassional pop but when it is free and readily available through work it becomes too easy to pass up. For my caffeine needs I have substituted chai tea lattes and lemon herbal tea during work hours.
