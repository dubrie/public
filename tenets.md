Tenets are my principles or doctrines that I aim to live my life by. By nature these change over time as priorities in my life change, I grow as a person, or when something is not benefiting or working towards a positive goal. I am following an [OKR format](https://rework.withgoogle.com/guides/set-goals-with-okrs/steps/introduction/) to make this more tangible as I work through the tenet progression of Hypothesis, Pattern, and Philosophy. An Hypothesis is something that I have theory about and am looking to prove out one way or another. If an Hypothesis is proven true, it becomes a Pattern that I add to my routine and establish on a more integrated level. If patterns prove to be valuable over a long period of time, then they become a Principle as something that is present and accounted for in my decision making, both actively and passively.

## Established Principles
Something I have whole-heartedly bought into and is a driving influence in all of my active and passive decision making.

- Measure, Compare, Adjust  
Create feedback loops everywhere I can including my own Philosophies, Beliefs, etc. Write things down as a commitment to them, measure progress, compare changes, adjust to maximize benefits and minimize negatives.  
Inspiration: [James Clear](http://jamesclear.com/feedback-loops)

- Sweat Once A Day  
Go for a run, take the stairs to/from your office or home, dance, do push-ups or sit-ups during television commercials, whatever it is you enjoy that makes you sweat - do it everyday.  
Inspiration: [Matthew McConaughey](http://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/movies/all-the-joy-of-oz/story-e6frf9h6-1111115440934?nk=663a4f3500f795d460097bc6a5bda9e2-1448396669)

-  Read 30 Minutes A Day  
It's rumored that Winston Churchill read a book every night because it helped him think better overall. I've found that when I make the space to read, especially long-format, it helps focus my thoughts and attention. 
Inspiration: [Winston Churchill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill)

- Show Up, Work Hard, Listen, Do What You Say You Are Going To Do  
I've subconsiously lived by these 4 rules but never had it put as succinctly as this until I heard Jim Harbaugh say it and saw it written on a wall in the University of Michigan football locker room. The best part for me is that none of these skills require talent or things outside of your control, just commitment and work ethic.

- Consistency Over Dogma  
Everyone has their own reasons and justifications for their actions, beliefs, or decisions. I am looking to be consistent in mine whether they align to or follow a defined groupthink or not. If I am for helping the less fortunate, or trying to combat climate change, or spaces over tabs when writing code (spoiler alert: I am), then I should also maintain those beliefs in my other actions that may not directly effect those issues. Fill out your understanding with new perspetives that challenge your own beliefs and assumptions.
