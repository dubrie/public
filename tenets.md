### Philosophies
Something I have whole-heartedly bought into and is a driving influence in all of my decision making.

- Measure, Compare, Adjust  
Create feedback loops everywhere I can including my own Philosophies, Beliefs, Lifehacks, etc. Write things down as a commitment to them, measure progress, compare changes, adjust to maximize benefits and minimize negatives.  
Inspiration: [James Clear](http://jamesclear.com/feedback-loops)

- Sweat Once A Day  
Go for a run, take the stairs to/from your office or home, dance, do push-ups or sit-ups during television commercials, whatever it is you enjoy that makes you sweat - do it everyday.  
Inspiration: [Matthew McConaughey](http://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/movies/all-the-joy-of-oz/story-e6frf9h6-1111115440934?nk=663a4f3500f795d460097bc6a5bda9e2-1448396669)

-  Read At Least 30 Minutes A Day  
It's rumored that Winston Churchill read a book every night because it helped him think better.  
Inspiration: [Winston Churchill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill)

- Be A Thermostat, Not A Thermometer  
Don't just report on the things around you, effect that change you want to see in them instead.  
Inspiration: [Cory Booker](https://www.facebook.com/corybooker/posts/10150525338532228)

- Show Up, Work Hard, Listen, Do What You Say You Are Going To Do  
I've always subconsiously lived by these 4 rules but never had it put as succinctly as this until I heard Jim Harbaugh say it and saw it written on a wall in the University of Michigan football locker room. The best part for me is that none of these skills require talent or things outside of your control, just commitment and work ethic.

- Consistency Over Dogma  
Everyone has their own reasons and justifications for their actions, beliefs, or decisions. I am looking to be consistent in mine whether they align to or follow a defined groupthink or not. If I am for helping the less fortunate, or trying to combat climate change, or spaces over tabs when writing code (spoiler alert: I am), then I should also maintain those beliefs in my other actions that may not directly effect those issues. 
Inspiration: General Observations

### Lifehacks
Little changes to a regimented routine in an attempt to get more out of what I'm already doing.

- Filters emails that contain the word "unsubscribe" to another folder  
Helps to reduce the noise of my inbox and allows me to address them as necessary.
Inspiration: [Inbox Zero](http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/zero-dark-inbox)

- Include Emojis  
I've found that including emoji characters in my messages slows down the speed at which I reply and forces me to think more about what I'm really trying to say. Also, they are entertaining.
Inspiration: [Your Brain Performs Better When It Slows Down](http://bigthink.com/think-tank/steven-kotler-flow-states)

- Don't Talk For 10 Minutes  
Unless I am leading a meeting or directly addressed, I refrain from talking for 10 minutes to absorb others perspectives and understanding of the issues at hand before weighing in myself.
Inspiration: [Amazon Meeting Policies](http://fortune.com/2012/11/16/amazons-jeff-bezos-the-ultimate-disrupter/)

- Train Like A Kenyan  
With my increased focus on endurance training I've started to get more scientific about my approach. The interesting thing is how a lot of the same takeaways can be applied to maintaining a healthy work/life balance.

### Recent Changes
Trying something new to see what the results are.

- Health, Wife, Life, Work  
In that order, the things I proritize in my life. I haven't done a great job keeping these balanced in the past so trying to use a principled approach of this heirarchy. Health and Wife are pretty straight forward, Life focuses on maintaining the balance between work and life and finding ways to not have my job be all encompassing, although things can span multiple categories.

- Review Tenants Quarterly  
The initial creation of my tenants (and the public repo in general) was a great way for me to collect my thoughts and write them down in an effort to hold myself accountable. Over time the accountability piece faded into the hustle and bustle of life and was forgotten. I have created quarterly calendar reminders to poke myself to revisit these with the hope of getting on a more regular cadence. Goal state is to not need the reminders anymore.

### Recent Results
The results from the things I've changed recently.  Successful trials can move to lifehacks and successful likehacks can move to philosophies. Unsuccessful trials will fall away and be retained here.

- Learn A New Language
  - Results: Unsuccessful
  - Details: Duolingo was nice for a few weeks and I made some progress but ultimately I hit a wall in the growth of the language. This could be app-related as you had to keep going backwards to review and progress significantly slowed. I also only devoted 20ish minutes an evening to it so probably not the proper level of commitment.
  - Description: I'm trying to become more precise in my language usage and have had some memory rentention issues lately, likely from the high amount of context switching involved in my work. Learning a new language has been known to help all 3 of those and having another language to use when we travel is a nice perk too!

- Don't Reuse Adjectives During The Day  
  - Results: Successful
  - Details: I'm calling this successful in that I have gotten good at not reusing adjectives during the day but I have also seen this cause communication issues, particularly with people that don't natively speak English. Looking to apply this conditionally going forward based on the scenario and group. [Vocabulary Size](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/14/magazine/14FOB-onlanguage-t.html?_r=0)  

- No Pop At Work  
  - Results: Mixed
  - Details: Still holding down that Starbucks MVP customer status but it is still incredibly convenient to just grab a pop from the work fridge. Still seeing improvements in sleep patterns by trying to limit caffeine consumption to the mornings and using cold water or walking outside instead of pop in the afternoons. With weather starting to improve this may be easier to manage going forward.  Inspiration: [Soda Is Worse Than Smoking](http://time.com/3513875/soda-may-age-you-as-much-as-smoking/)  

- Wake Up 1 Hour Earlier  
  - Results: Mixed
  - Details: I recently got back from a trip to Italy and the jet lag has been waking me up in the 4-5am hours instead of my normal 6-7am hours. With daylight creeping earlier and earlier as well I want to try to keep this trend going and see if there is a change in my productivity, activity, energy, and bedtime. I've struggled with falling asleep at night so the hope is that waking up early will help my productivity for the day as well as getting me to sleep at night.

- Stand Whenever Possible  
  - Results: Successful
  - Details: I've been using a stand-up desk for about 5 years now but because of a weird bug that messes up [window sizes when disconnecting a MacBook Pro from an external monitor](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/chrome/nDXWuqYj2zA), I've been sitting more at my desk with my laptop. I'm also training for my 4th marathon (and hopefully 5th!) where posture and form is very important especially in the later miles. Standing at my desk for 6 hours a day should help me get the core strength and posture back to levels that will help in training/race.

- No Pop At Work  
  - Results: Successful
  - Details: I've become a much bigger customer at the local Starbucks and Tea/Coffee Shops since changing this which has required a few adjustments to my budget but my sleep patterns have vastly improved and I haven't been sick outside of a runny nose here and there. My energy levels at work have gone up with the drop in sugary drink intake and I feel less drained at the end of the day. The dentist even noticed a difference in my tooth enamel and pockets which I will partially attribute to this.

- No Laptops At Meetings  
  - Results: Mixed
  - Details: Switching jobs has made this much more difficult to achieve. I still try to do this but I don't quite have a 1:1 functionality mapping for things I can do on a laptop and things I can do with a phone. Simple notes or research is easy but accessing corporate websites/documents or editing wiki pages is pretty tricky. I started this because most meetings are poorly run and have poor time management. Refusing to bring a laptop unless absolutely necessary has forced me to focus on what every person is saying and quickly call out things that are not relevant to goal of the meeting. There seems to be a much sharper focus on meeting value and efficiency at the new company as well.
