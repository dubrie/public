It's been a while since I haven't finished a book. I had hope for this based on recommendations and what I thought was the concept of approaching engineering to support and encompass civilization. It turns out the focus was on the civil engineering discipline and a little on engineering as a general study or practice. The pattern of using a formal definition to describe the thing you are writing about without also providing some new insight or approach made for a slow read without a lot of value and felt very textbook-y or even encyclopedia. Where the book ultimately lost me was the chapters the authors begins to make wide sweeping declarations about "who engineers are". It was dripping of gatekeeping, especially on the gender differences, and became emblematic for what I hate in the engineering profession. I can see the line of thought for comments like "by definition Engineers can't be revolutionists", but cannot agree with it being a true statement. I skipped around on the chapters for the 2nd half but these themes and sentiments seemed to still be present. All in all, not worth a read.


Some highlights from my reading:
1. That is what engineers do. They occupy the vast middle spectrum between theoretical scientists and sub-professional technicians.
1. Civilization flourishes because specialists rely upon one another to perform particular tasks.
1. Out of the discontent of the sixties there grew a more humane technology, with more concern for aesthetics, safety, and environmental preservation. And among engineers there developed a keener appreciation of the moral importance and creative richness—the existential pleasures—of their profession.
1. Nevertheless, without imagination, heightened awareness, moral sense, and some reference to the general culture, the engineering experience becomes less meaningful, less fulfilling than it should be. When getting a job is more discussed than the quality of life, I fear that the existential pleasures of engineering may be adversely affected. It is the obligation and privilege of each engineer to do everything possible to prevent this from happening.
