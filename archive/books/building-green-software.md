While this book is not officially released yet, I was fortunate enough to be selected as a Technical Reviewer by O'Reilly for it so I've been able to read through the entire thing already. I know the authors, Sara, Sarah, and Anne, through my time with the Green Software Foundation and they did a fantastic job presenting a critical topic in modern software engineering. Throughout the book, they provide data-driven reasons for adopting a green software approach and how your business or product will directly benefit across multiple pillars like reliability, security, and cost of goods and services. The more you learn about green software principles and patterns, the more you realize that it could (should?) be the over-arching lens into all software as it directly connects efforts throughout the stack, customer experience, and business priorities. Similar to how Google (and others) made SLOs the singular lens to measure and drive reliability through a system, I believe that green software can do the same to drive sustainability through our systems. Strongly recommend this book once it is available as this will become the underlying mechanism for all software over the next decade!

No notes or takeaways here as I don't want to undermine the book itself before it is released.
