I'm guessing that I totally missed something about this book because it seems like it has very little plot or purpose and the parts that appear like they should be funny, are not. It is presented in diary form so maybe that is making it harder to process or follow? I'd be curious to watch a movie of this to see if there are subtle things I didn't pick up on in the reading but I just could not get into this one at all. Oh well! 

Some highlights from my reading:
*none*
