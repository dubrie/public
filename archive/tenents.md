### Tenet Overview
Tenets are my principles or doctrines that I aim to live my life by. By nature these change over time as priorities in my life change, I grow as a person, or find something not benefiting or working towards a positive goal. Tenets follow 3 stages: Hypothesis, Lifehack, Philosophy. A Hypothesis is something that I have theory about and am looking to prove out one way or another. If a hypothesis is proven true, it becomes a Lifehack as something that I am adding to my routine and trying on a more integrated level. If Lifehacks prove out to be very valuable they would be promoted to a Principle as something that is a factor nearly all of my decision making both actively and passively. 

### Principles
Something I have whole-heartedly bought into and is a driving influence in all of my active and passive decision making.

- Measure, Compare, Adjust  
Create feedback loops everywhere I can including my own Philosophies, Beliefs, Lifehacks, etc. Write things down as a commitment to them, measure progress, compare changes, adjust to maximize benefits and minimize negatives.

- Sweat Once A Day  
Go for a run, take the stairs to/from your office or home, dance, do push-ups or sit-ups during television commercials, whatever it is you enjoy that makes you sweat - do it everyday.  
Inspiration: [Matthew McConaughey](http://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/movies/all-the-joy-of-oz/story-e6frf9h6-1111115440934?nk=663a4f3500f795d460097bc6a5bda9e2-1448396669)

-  Read At Least 30 Minutes A Day  
It's rumored that Winston Churchill read a book every night because it helped him think better.  
Inspiration: [Winston Churchill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Churchill)

- Be A Thermostat, Not A Thermometer  
Don't just report on the things around you, effect that change you want to see in them instead.  
Inspiration: [Cory Booker](https://www.facebook.com/corybooker/posts/10150525338532228)

- Show Up, Work Hard, Listen, Do What You Say You Are Going To Do  
I've always subconsiously lived by these 4 rules but never had it put as succinctly as this until I heard Jim Harbaugh say it and saw it written on a wall in the University of Michigan football locker room. The best part for me is that none of these skills require talent or things outside of your control, just commitment and work ethic.  
Inspiration: [Jim Harbaugh's 4 things to do every day](http://coachingsearch.com/article?a=Jim-Harbaughs-4-things-to-do-every-day)

- Consistency Over Dogma  
Everyone has their own reasons and justifications for their actions, beliefs, or decisions. I am looking to be consistent in mine whether they align to or follow a defined groupthink or not. If I am for helping the less fortunate, or trying to combat climate change, or spaces over tabs when writing code (spoiler alert: I am), then I should also maintain those beliefs in my other actions that may not directly effect those issues. 
Inspiration: General Observations

### Lifehacks
Deliberate changes to my routine in an attempt to get more out of something I'm already doing.

- Filters emails that contain the word "unsubscribe" to another folder  
Helps to reduce the noise of my inbox and allows me to address them as necessary.
Inspiration: [Inbox Zero](http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/zero-dark-inbox)

- Include Emojis  
I've found that including emoji characters in my messages slows down the speed at which I reply and forces me to think more about what I'm really trying to say. Also, they are entertaining.
Inspiration: [Your Brain Performs Better When It Slows Down](http://bigthink.com/think-tank/steven-kotler-flow-states)

- Don't Talk For 10 Minutes  
Unless I am leading a meeting or directly addressed, I refrain from talking for 10 minutes to absorb others perspectives and understanding of the issues at hand before weighing in myself.
Inspiration: [Amazon Meeting Policies](http://fortune.com/2012/11/16/amazons-jeff-bezos-the-ultimate-disrupter/)

- Train Like A Kenyan  
With my increased focus on endurance training I've started to get more scientific about my approach. The interesting thing is how a lot of the same takeaways can be applied to maintaining a healthy work/life balance like Get Your Rest, Start Slow and Build, Run With Others, and Go For Walks.

- Timed Events At the Start & End of the Workday
Living where you work has been a unique challenge to undertake these past 4 months. I've used markers at the start, midddle, and end of the day to signal to my brain that I am switching modes. In the morning, after I finish walking my dog and then making breakfast, I start my day. The dog also gets a walk at lunch time before I make lunch, and then every evening at 6pm pacific I have started playing HQ Trivia as a way to actively switch away from work and then walk the dog afterwards. My dog really appreciates this lifehack! 

### Hypotheses

- No Blocking Twitter Users
This clearly isn't an option for some people, but my hope is that my realatively low profile will allow me to focus on constructive engagement of all types of perspectives. My hope is that it will allow me to learn the underlying reasons people feel so strongly and identify ways to effectively communicate with all kinds of backgrounds and perspectives. I'm leaning heavily on a probably flawed assumption that people are generally rational and want good things. 

- Don't Sleep In
Regardless of when I fall asleep, try to wake up within a hour of the same time every day. The theory is that keeping my wake-up time consistent will help level out my bedtime and result in more quality sleep overall. 


### Changes and Results

#### Recent Changes
Trying something new to see what the results are.

- Review Tenants Every 6 Months  (changed 12/8/19)  
The initial creation of my tenants (and the public repo in general) was a great way for me to collect my thoughts and write them down in an effort to hold myself accountable. Over time the accountability piece faded into the hustle and bustle of life and was forgotten. I will strive to revisit these every 6 months with the hope of getting on a more regular cadence. 

- Heal The Internet  (added 12/8/19)  
This is a rallying cry from David Heinemeier Hansson ([@DHH](https://twitter.com/dhh)) to combat the [consolidation of functionality on the internet down to a few big companies](https://m.signalvnoise.com/you-can-heal-the-internet/). I am taking this at a slightly different level and making sure that I am concious of the service choices I make on the internet and what that means for the larger ecosystem. Looking to replace at least 3 every-week items with something not tied to Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, or Apple. 

- Listen For A Year (added 12/8/19)  
In the same vein as the "Don't talk for 10 minutes" Lifehack, filmaker dream hampton gave some advice on a podcast to "First, listen for a year" to people that wanted to get more involved politically. It forces you to understand the problem at a much deeper level before trying to enact change. I use this approach in my current role for helping engineering teams and while sometimes not fully appreciated in fast-moving environment like software engineer, it typically has provided better results overtime even if a little slower at first.
Inspiration: [https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2019/08/piper-perabo-resistance-celebrity.html]

- Health, Wife, Life, Work  (added 8/31/18)  
In that order, the things I proritize in my life. I haven't done a great job keeping these balanced in the past so trying to use a principled approach of this heirarchy. Health and Wife are pretty straight forward, Life focuses on maintaining the balance between work and life and finding ways to not have my job be all encompassing, although things can span multiple categories.

#### Recent Results
The results from the things I've changed recently.  Successful trials can move to lifehacks and successful likehacks can move to philosophies. Unsuccessful trials will fall away and be retained here.

- Listen For A Year (6/26/20)  
- Results: Mixed
- Details: While not exactly a year, I've started being more active and vocal to sustainability efforts within my company and life. I have been focusing on this during the Black Lives Matter protests and defaulting to listening and amplifying voices instead. Similarly, I've been trying to listen as much as possible during COVID-19 to focus on science-backed data and facts instead of emotionally or politically-charged information. This has been difficult to maintian at times and I have caught myself losing grip on this tenet and then work to bring it to the front of my focus.

- Heal The Internet  (6/26/20)  
  - Results: Successful
  - Details: Goal was to replace 3 everyday things and I've switched out my web browser, email, search engine, and ordering directly from suppliers instead of Amazon. By each company -- Facebook: zero(?) usage of Facebook/WhatsApp and drastic drop of Instagram use (26 posts first 6 months of 2019, 5 posts first 6 months of 2020). Google: Switched main search engine to DuckDuckGo, Started using Apple Maps, dropped Waze usage, Started using HEY instead of Gmail, switched browser from Chrome to Edge & Firefox, Amazon: 7 orders first 6 months of 2019, 16 orders first 6 months of 2020. 9 were COVID-related so its basically a push. Stopped purchasing from Amazon Music and started paying for Spotify instead. Microsoft/Apple: Haven't made many switches away and have actually moved some actions to them.

- Review Tenants Every 6 Months (6/26/20)
  - Results: Successful
  - Details: Doing this every 6 months seems to be way more natural and allows for a better understanding of things that have taken hold and not. It also aligns to how the company I work for groups major planning cycles so my mindset is more aligned to retrospective and long-term thinking and planning
  - Description: The initial creation of my tenants (and the public repo in general) was a great way for me to collect my thoughts and write them down in an effort to hold myself accountable. Over time the accountability piece faded into the hustle and bustle of life and was forgotten. I will strive to revisit these every 6 months with the hope of getting on a more regular cadence.


- Do Less, Better (12/8/19)
  - Results: Unsuccessful
  - Details: Started well for a couple months but my instinct is to fill the voids with more "stuff" to do which then turns into ownership which then requires more attention and spreading myself out until I hit some sort of breaking point. I have to think about a better way to keep this in check. 
  - Description: The past 6 months or so has been a very breadth-focused effort mostly in work but also outside of it a bit. With some changes in my organization at work I have the chance to start to focus deeper on less areas for higher success in the areas I'm focused on. My naturaul instinct is help wherever and whenever I can but that leads to spreading myself out to the point that I cannot meet the expectations set.

- Review Tenants Quarterly (12/8/19)
  - Results: Unsuccessful
  - Details: Quarterly seems a bit too quick for my schedule and the time I want to alot to each of these. Switching this to every 6 months going forward to maintain some accountability.
  - Description: The initial creation of my tenants (and the public repo in general) was a great way for me to collect my thoughts and write them down in an effort to hold myself accountable. Over time the accountability piece faded into the hustle and bustle of life and was forgotten. I have created quarterly calendar reminders to poke myself to revisit these with the hope of getting on a more regular cadence. Goal state is to not need the reminders anymore.

- Learn A New Language (8/31/18)
  - Results: Unsuccessful
  - Details: Duolingo was nice for a few weeks and I made some progress but ultimately I hit a wall in the growth of the language. This could be app-related as you had to keep going backwards to review and progress significantly slowed. I also only devoted 20ish minutes an evening to it so probably not the proper level of commitment.
  - Description: I'm trying to become more precise in my language usage and have had some memory rentention issues lately, likely from the high amount of context switching involved in my work. Learning a new language has been known to help all 3 of those and having another language to use when we travel is a nice perk too!

- Don't Reuse Adjectives During The Day  (4/2/18)
  - Results: Successful
  - Details: I'm calling this successful in that I have gotten good at not reusing adjectives during the day but I have also seen this cause communication issues, particularly with people that don't natively speak English. Looking to apply this conditionally going forward based on the scenario and group. [Vocabulary Size](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/14/magazine/14FOB-onlanguage-t.html?_r=0)  

- No Pop At Work  (4/2/18)
  - Results: Mixed
  - Details: Still holding down that Starbucks MVP customer status but it is still incredibly convenient to just grab a pop from the work fridge. Still seeing improvements in sleep patterns by trying to limit caffeine consumption to the mornings and using cold water or walking outside instead of pop in the afternoons. With weather starting to improve this may be easier to manage going forward.  Inspiration: [Soda Is Worse Than Smoking](http://time.com/3513875/soda-may-age-you-as-much-as-smoking/)  

- Wake Up 1 Hour Earlier  (10/11/17)
  - Results: Mixed
  - Details: I recently got back from a trip to Italy and the jet lag has been waking me up in the 4-5am hours instead of my normal 6-7am hours. With daylight creeping earlier and earlier as well I want to try to keep this trend going and see if there is a change in my productivity, activity, energy, and bedtime. I've struggled with falling asleep at night so the hope is that waking up early will help my productivity for the day as well as getting me to sleep at night.

- Stand Whenever Possible  (5/4/16)
  - Results: Successful
  - Details: I've been using a stand-up desk for about 5 years now but because of a weird bug that messes up [window sizes when disconnecting a MacBook Pro from an external monitor](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/chrome/nDXWuqYj2zA), I've been sitting more at my desk with my laptop. I'm also training for my 4th marathon (and hopefully 5th!) where posture and form is very important especially in the later miles. Standing at my desk for 6 hours a day should help me get the core strength and posture back to levels that will help in training/race.

- No Pop At Work  (1/3/16)
  - Results: Successful
  - Details: I've become a much bigger customer at the local Starbucks and Tea/Coffee Shops since changing this which has required a few adjustments to my budget but my sleep patterns have vastly improved and I haven't been sick outside of a runny nose here and there. My energy levels at work have gone up with the drop in sugary drink intake and I feel less drained at the end of the day. The dentist even noticed a difference in my tooth enamel and pockets which I will partially attribute to this.

- No Laptops At Meetings  (4/14/17)
  - Results: Mixed
  - Details: Switching jobs has made this much more difficult to achieve. I still try to do this but I don't quite have a 1:1 functionality mapping for things I can do on a laptop and things I can do with a phone. Simple notes or research is easy but accessing corporate websites/documents or editing wiki pages is pretty tricky. I started this because most meetings are poorly run and have poor time management. Refusing to bring a laptop unless absolutely necessary has forced me to focus on what every person is saying and quickly call out things that are not relevant to goal of the meeting. There seems to be a much sharper focus on meeting value and efficiency at the new company as well.
