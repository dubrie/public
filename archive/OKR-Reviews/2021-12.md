### Become a better friend and family member
1. Connect with 5 friends per week

1. Connect with 2 family members per week  
    * Status: Missed 1 week in February, 2 weeks in April, end of August was very light, early November was very light as well, but Decemeber and holidays brought many more opportunities for me. 
    * Time constraints of work and just general languishing have made this tricky through the year.
  
1. Connect with 2 new co-workers per month

### Explore the natural world to gain better perspective on the planet
1. 1 10k+ trail run per week and 2 first-time trails per month  
    * Status: Took a lot of time off from running post marathons and missed the Novemeber mark. December was met through Boston training starting up and getting out onto the trails with some local trail running friends. Will continue this pattern for the bulk of my training to leverage the mountains as prep for the Netwon hills
