## Reflections on 2022 OKRs
This was a much improved setup and execution this year by focusing more on measuring. I had zero inconclusive OKRs this time around (down from 2 last time) and was able to meet 6 out of 9 OKRs overall which is a 66% hitrate and very close to the overall 70% barrier. Of the ones I missed, 2 were with a few percentage points of hitting and the 3rd was just too big of a stretch. The Carbon Footprint offset goal was intentionally big to force myself into going beyond and even with the miss I was able to offset over 4x of my footprint this year. I think I'm most proud of hitting 100% on the reading goals and running with other people. I've started to hit a groove with both now and look forward to expanding them in the future. Only hitting 1 of 3 on the Be a better citizen of the planet is disappointing to me but it still allowed me to measure and analyze my impact better and will allow me to shift from offsetting to abatement and reduction in the next year and beyond. I'm not sure if I will keep the same format for 2023 or not but this has been a really great experiment and helped me improve in a number of ways.
