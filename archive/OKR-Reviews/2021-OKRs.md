## Reflections on 2021 OKRs
This was a good first attempt at this process and helped make OKRs more clear to me. I missed a few of these by not having a great way to measure the result from the beginning, should be easy to correct going forward. The other misses were from not meeting the metric and the monthly reviews provide some detail as to why I was unable to meet it. The OKRs I successfully completed were all things I was intentionally working at and striving to do more of -- Read, Network, and Run -- so it's not surprising those were successful. A couple close misses with Focus Time, National Parks, and Blogging -- 3 things I strived for (valuing my time, travel, and writing down my thoughts) but was ultimately willing to sacrifice for other areas. For 2022 I'm wondering if there is a way to frame as "Will do", "Should do", and "Would like to do" to make my compromises clearer and more honest.
