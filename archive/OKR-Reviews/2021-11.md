1. Maintain 30% focus time (2+ hour blocks) at work per week  
    * Status: Just under 30% for October due to extra space in my calendar from spinning down my responsiblities in my former role. Ramping up in the new role brought this back down temporarily but am being intentional about guarding my focus time and will have some holidays to balance this out a bit.
