1. Maintain 30% focus time (2+ hour blocks) at work per week  
    * Status: Dropped back down below 30% for September for one of my worst months on record. This was mostly due to compression of schedule with my vacation, cluster of meetings post re-org, and a lot of projects ramping up. Should be able to space things out again now that I'm back.
